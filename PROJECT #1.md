# Azure-IT-Support-Portfolio
Hands-on Azure IT Support &amp; Cloud Support projects

# *PROJECT 1*: # *AZURE VIRTUAL MACHINE DEPLOYMENT & TROUBLESHOOTING*

# 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates hands-on experience deploying, configuring, and troubleshooting Linux virtual machines on Microsoft Azure.
It reflects real-world IT Support / Cloud Support responsibilities such as VM provisioning, authentication configuration, deployment issue resolution, and cost optimization using Azure CLI.

🧑‍💻 Role

IT Support/Cloud Support

# ☁️  Environment & Tools

# Cloud Platform: Microsoft Azure
# Operating System: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
# Deployment Methods: Azure Portal, ARM Templates
# Command Line: Azure CLI
# Authentication: SSH Keys, Username & Password

🔧 Hands-on Tasks Performed

1️⃣ Virtual Machine Deployment

Deployed Linux (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS) Virtual Machines using:
* Azure Portal (GUI)
* ARM Templates (Infrastructure as Code)
* Selected VM sizes, regions, networking, and storage configurations.


2️⃣ Authentication Configuration

Configured VM access using:
* SSH public/private key authentication
* Username and password login
* Validated secure remote access to Linux VMs.

3️⃣ Troubleshooting & Issue Resolution:

Resolved common Azure VM deployment and access issues, including:

❌ Managed OS disk reference errors

❌ OSProfile misconfiguration issues

❌ Authentication errors:

* Permission denied (publickey)

* Password authentication failures

* Verified Azure resource provider settings and template dependencies.

4️⃣ VM Monitoring & Management (Azure CLI)
Checked VM runtime states:
* Running
* Stopped
* Deallocated
* Started and stopped virtual machines using Azure CLI commands to:
* Optimize cloud costs
* Control availability during testing
