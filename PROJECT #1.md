#### *PROJECT 1*: *AZURE VIRTUAL MACHINE DEPLOYMENT & TROUBLESHOOTING*

#### **Project Overview 📌**

This project demonstrates hands-on experience deploying, configuring, and troubleshooting Linux virtual machines on Microsoft Azure.
It reflects real-world IT Support / Cloud Support responsibilities such as VM provisioning, authentication configuration, deployment issue resolution, and cost optimization using Azure CLI.

🧑‍💻 **Role:** 
_IT Support/Cloud Support_

#### ☁️  Environment & Tools: 

💡**Cloud Platform: Microsoft Azure**

💡**Operating System: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS**

💡**Deployment Methods: Azure Portal, ARM Templates**

💡**Command Line: Azure CLI**

💡**Authentication: SSH Keys, Username & Password**

## 🔧 Hands-on Tasks Performed (What I Did)

1️⃣ **Virtual Machine Deployment**

Deployed Linux (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS) Virtual Machines using:
* Azure Portal (GUI)
* ARM Templates (Infrastructure as Code)
* Selected VM sizes, regions, networking, and storage configurations.


2️⃣ **Authentication Configuration**

Configured VM access using:
* SSH public/private key authentication
* Username and password login
* Validated secure remote access to Linux VMs.

3️⃣ **Troubleshooting & Issue Resolution:**

Resolved common Azure VM deployment and access issues, including:

❌ Managed OS disk reference errors

❌ OSProfile misconfiguration issues

❌ Authentication errors:

* Permission denied (publickey)

* Password authentication failures

* Verified Azure resource provider settings and template dependencies.

4️⃣ **VM Monitoring & Management (Azure CLI)**
Checked VM runtime states:
* Running
* Stopped
* Deallocated
* Started and stopped virtual machines using Azure CLI commands to:
* Optimize cloud costs
* Control availability during testing
